        <p id="woohoo">Once upon a time there was a kid who loved to hug</p>
        <p>though he enjoyed it, others found it starting to bug</p>
        <p>So he set off to find people just like him</p>
        <p>looking for fellow huggers, he came across the land of limbim</p>
        <p>He ran towards the valley thinking "finally I belong"</p>
        <p>He tried to hug the people but they were too strong </p>
        <p> They couldn't hug him back or he would be crushed</p>
        <p>and he was not happy, so away he rushed</p>
        <p>it went again and again for many different lands</p>
        <p>each had a trait that wasnt for hugging, each unliked by his hugging hands</p>
        <p>then finally defeated, he went home</p>
        <p>he was welcomed home warmly. he had learned one thing on his roam</p>
        <p>that there was no place like home</p>
